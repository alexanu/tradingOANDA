#### fetching historical data ####

# fetching historical data has two components
#  a) fetching recent historical data
#  b) fetching historical data
# a) refers to a continuous process that requests keepUpToDate bars for all conIds in scope (in parallel)
# b) refers to a continuous process that fetches historical data for all conIds; but this process runs serial
#    and starts at the first conId, going up from the earliestDateTime to now.

# The following determines the range for which we will continuously fetch historical data
# if this setting is  < 0, fetch all dates starting from the earliest time point that is found in the
# market data table. If no date exist, start from 2000-01-01
# if this setting is > 0, only fetch the data that is within [now - earliest_time_delta_historical_ata, now].
